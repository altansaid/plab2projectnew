# Consultation UI Improvement - Remove Feedback Notes During Consultation

## üéØ **CHANGE REQUEST COMPLETED**

### **Issue Description**

During the Consultation phase, both Patient and Observer roles were showing a "Feedback Notes" input box on their screen, which was not the intended behavior.

### **Requirements**

- Remove the Feedback Notes box from Patient and Observer screens during Consultation phase
- Show only "Consultation in Progress" message with timer during consultation
- Ensure feedback input appears only after consultation phase ends (in feedback phase)

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **Before (Problematic UI):**

During consultation phase, Patient and Observer saw:

- Split screen layout with consultation info on left (8 columns)
- Large feedback notes input box on right (4 columns)
- Distracting sidebar with feedback guidelines
- Premature feedback collection during active consultation

### **After (Improved UI):**

During consultation phase, Patient and Observer now see:

- Clean, centered full-width layout (12 columns)
- Prominent "Consultation in Progress" heading
- Clear timer display with progress bar
- Role-specific instructions without distractions
- Professional, focused consultation experience

      {/* Prominent centered timer */}
      <Box sx={{ textAlign: "center", mb: 4 }}>

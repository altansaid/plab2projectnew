# Major UI/UX Bug Fixes & Session Cleanup Implementation

## Summary of Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. üîß **Skip Button Flickering & Response Issues**

**Problem:** The "Skip to Consultation" button during Reading Time was flickering (hover state repeatedly triggering) and had delayed/unresponsive clicks.

**Root Cause:**

- No debouncing mechanism for rapid button clicks
- Material-UI hover state conflicts with frequent re-renders
- Missing loading states causing confusion

**Solution Implemented:**

- **Debounced Button Handler System**: Created `createDebouncedHandler()` function that prevents multiple rapid clicks
- **Button State Management**: Added `buttonStates` to track loading states for all buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons show "Skipping...", "Loading..." states during operations
- **Hover State Fixes**: Added CSS to prevent transform animations that cause flickering
- **Focus Outline Prevention**: Removed focus outline flickering

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/components/session/SessionRoom.tsx` - Added debouncing and button state management

### 2. üìù **Feedback Text Box Focus & Input Issues**

**Problem:** Feedback text boxes could not be focused or typed in, regardless of browser.

**Root Cause:**

- Complex timer interpolation system was causing frequent re-renders
- Event handlers were being recreated on every render
- Material-UI TextField losing focus due to parent component re-renders

**Solution Implemented:**

- **Separated Timer State**: Removed complex timer interpolation that was causing re-renders
- **Stable Event Handlers**: Used `useCallback` with empty dependency arrays for feedback handlers
- **Unique Input IDs**: Added role-specific IDs to prevent conflicts
- **Enhanced Input Props**: Added proper InputProps with resize prevention and focus styling
- **Simplified State Management**: Removed throttling that was interfering with input focus

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/components/session/SessionRoom.tsx` - Simplified timer, stabilized handlers

### 3. ‚è±Ô∏è **Timer Instability & Synchronization Issues**

**Problem:** Session countdown was jumping, speeding up, slowing down, and not reliable or smooth.

**Root Cause:**

- Complex client-side interpolation system trying to smooth server updates
- Throttling conflicts between server updates and client rendering
- Over-engineered timer sync mechanism

**Solution Implemented:**

- **Simplified Timer Logic**: Removed complex interpolation and throttling
- **Direct Server Updates**: Timer now updates directly from WebSocket messages
- **Stable Progress Calculation**: Fixed progress percentage calculation
- **Removed Client-Side Timer**: Eliminated conflicting client-side countdown
- **Better Error Handling**: Added negative time protection

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/components/session/SessionRoom.tsx` - Simplified timer implementation
- `backend/src/main/java/com/plabpractice/api/service/SessionWebSocketService.java` - Enhanced timer broadcasting

### 4. üö™ **Session Lifecycle & Cleanup Logic**

**Problem:** When users left sessions (closed tab, navigated away), sessions continued running in backend with no cleanup or participant notification.

**Root Cause:**

- No browser unload event handling
- Missing backend endpoint for session leaving
- No participant count monitoring
- No session termination logic

**Solution Implemented:**

#### Frontend Cleanup:

- **Browser Event Handling**: Added `beforeunload`, `unload`, and `visibilitychange` listeners
- **Exit Confirmation Dialog**: Added user-friendly exit confirmation
- **Cleanup Function**: Comprehensive `cleanupSession()` function
- **WebSocket Disconnect**: Proper WebSocket cleanup on exit
- **Session End Detection**: Automatic redirect when session ends

#### Backend Session Management:

- **Leave Session Endpoint**: `POST /sessions/{sessionCode}/leave`
- **Participant Removal**: Automatic participant cleanup when users leave
- **Session End Logic**: Sessions end when < 2 participants or no doctor remains
- **Real-time Notifications**: All remaining participants notified when someone leaves
- **Session Status Updates**: Proper session status transitions

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/src/components/session/SessionRoom.tsx` - Added cleanup logic and exit handling
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Added leaveSession API and WebSocket event handlers
- `backend/src/main/java/com/plabpractice/api/controller/SessionController.java` - Added leave endpoint
- `backend/src/main/java/com/plabpractice/api/service/SessionWebSocketService.java` - Added user leave and session end handling

### 5. üßπ **Code Quality & Performance Improvements**

**Removed Unnecessary Code:**

- Complex timer interpolation system
- Throttling mechanisms that interfered with UI
- Redundant state management
- Over-engineered WebSocket handling

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Reduced re-render frequency
- Stabilized event handlers
- Simplified state updates
- Cleaner component lifecycle

## New Features Added

### Session End Notifications

- Clear "Session Ended" messages for all participants
- Automatic redirect to dashboard after session ends
- Reason-specific messaging (not enough participants, doctor left, etc.)

### Enhanced User Experience

- Loading states for all interactive buttons
- Debounced button interactions prevent spam clicking
- Improved input field styling and focus behavior
- Exit confirmation dialog prevents accidental session leaving

### Real-time Session Management

- Participant count monitoring
- Automatic session termination when appropriate
- Real-time updates when users join/leave
- Proper session status lifecycle management

## Testing Verification

### Button Responsiveness Test

1. ‚úÖ **Skip Button**: Click once ‚Üí immediate response, button shows "Skipping..." state
2. ‚úÖ **No Flickering**: Button hover states stable, no rapid state changes
3. ‚úÖ **Debouncing**: Multiple rapid clicks ignored, single operation executed

### Feedback Input Test

1. ‚úÖ **Focus Retention**: Click in feedback box ‚Üí cursor appears and stays
2. ‚úÖ **Continuous Typing**: Type for 30+ seconds ‚Üí no focus loss during timer updates
3. ‚úÖ **Cross-Browser**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Timer Stability Test

1. ‚úÖ **Smooth Countdown**: Timer counts down steadily without jumps
2. ‚úÖ **Multi-User Sync**: All participants see same time (within 1 second)
3. ‚úÖ **No Speed Variations**: Consistent 1-second intervals

### Session Cleanup Test

1. ‚úÖ **Tab Close**: Close browser tab ‚Üí other participants notified
2. ‚úÖ **Navigation Away**: Go to dashboard ‚Üí session cleaned up
3. ‚úÖ **Insufficient Participants**: User leaves ‚Üí session ends for remaining users
4. ‚úÖ **Exit Dialog**: Click exit ‚Üí confirmation shown before leaving

## Technical Architecture Improvements
